- Rule #1: Don't look at the example project's code on CodePen. Figure it out for yourself.
- Rule #2: You may use whichever libraries or APIs you need
- Rule #3: Reverse engineer the example project's functionality, and also feel free to personalize it.
- Here are the user stories you must enable, and optional bonus user stories:
- [ ] User Story: As a user, I can see the weather in my current location.
- [ ] Bonus User Story: As a user, I can see an icon depending on the temperature.
- [ ] Bonus User Story: As a user, I see a different background image depending on the temperature (e.g. snowy mountain, hot desert).
- [ ] Bonus User Story: As a user, I can push a button to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius.
